<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

This project builds a book recommender that combines a popularity-based model with a collaborative filtering model using the Book-Crossing dataset of books, users, and ratings. It  performs exploratory statistics, and then generates recommendations from both overall popularity and user‚Äìitem similarity computed.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="applications"></a>Applications</h2>

- Enhances user experience on e-commerce or online library platforms
- Helps users discover books they might enjoy based on their reading history
- Supports personalized content delivery in educational or entertainment apps

1. **Popularity model:**
- Groupby/aggregate to compute counts and mean ratings, then rank to identify top books by engagement and quality signals. Gives top 50 vendors by mean ratings.
2. **Collaborative filtering:**
- Builds a sparse user‚Äìitem matrix via pivot, then applies cosine similarity and k-nearest neighbors from scikit-learn to find and recommend similar items.
- Implemented RapidFuzz to handle typos, whitespace variations, and capitalization differences in order to accurately match user inputs to the correct book title.
- Recommend() function to recommend similar books based on user ratings.
3. **Logistic regression classifiers:** 
- One uses metadata and ID features to predict whether a user‚Äôs rating is a ‚Äúlike‚Äù (rating ‚â• 7), and another predicts ‚Äúwill like‚Äù from collaborative-neighborhood features derived from item‚Äìitem similarity, with decision made by a tuned probability threshold.
- The metadata model predicts like-probability for any row with the required features, enabling bulk scoring of user‚Äìbook pairs from the merged table.
- The neighborhood model exposes will_like(book_name, user_id), which resolves a title to a known ISBN, computes features for that user‚Äìitem, and returns ‚ÄúYes‚Äù if the predicted probability exceeds the tuned threshold

<h2><a class="anchor" id="conclusions"></a>Conculsions</h2>

- Lists of top 10 popular books with rating counts and average ratings include the Harry Potter series, The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and To Kill a Mocking Bird.
- Ratings are highly sparse and skewed: many entries are zeros, with median rating at 0 and the 75th percentile at 7, indicating an implicit/explicit split that motivates filtering and robust thresholding for ‚Äúlike‚Äù definitions.
